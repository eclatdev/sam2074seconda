	<p align="justify">An element usually consists of an opening tag (<element_name>), a closing tag (</element_name>), which contain the
element's name surrounded by angle brackets, and the content in between:
<element_name>...content...</element_name>
There are some HTML elements that don't have a closing tag or any contents. These are called void elements. Void
elements include <img>, <meta>, <link> and <input>.
Element names can be thought of as descriptive keywords for the content they contain, such as video, audio,
table, footer.
A HTML page may consist of potentially hundreds of elements which are then read by a web browser, interpreted
and rendered into human readable or audible content on the screen.
For this document it is important to note the difference between elements and tags:
Elements: video, audio, table, footer
